## P0 — Security + First Impression Killers

Fix before any outreach. Security items from verification audit included here.

| # | Issue | Details | Status |
|---|-------|---------|--------|
| P0.1 | **CRITICAL: Anyone can register any domain** | Attacker registers `google.com`, becomes admin, verifies fake claims. Require registrant's email domain to match org domain. (`routes/team.py`, org creation) | `done` |
| P0.2 | **CRITICAL: Remove legacy admin_email fallback** | If attacker gets auth account with email matching org's `admin_email`, they auto-become admin. Delete lines 120-163 in `middleware/auth.py`. | `done` |
| P0.3 | **CRITICAL: Self-join = auto-admin if first** | First person from `@company.com` to self-join becomes admin with all permissions. Require admin approval for self-join; domain match creates `status=pending`. (`routes/team.py:293-428`) | `done` |
| P0.4 | **Block public email domain org registration** | Nobody should register `gmail.com` or `yahoo.com` as their company. Add blocklist of public email domains. | `done` |
| P0.5 | **Add 30-day TTL to verification tokens** | Tokens never expire. Leaked token valid forever. Add `token_expires_at` column, check in `routes/verify.py`. | `done` |
| P0.6 | **Invalidate old tokens on re-submission** | When candidate re-edits after dispute, old token not explicitly killed. Set old `verification_token = NULL` before generating new one. (`routes/claims.py:250`) | `done` |
| P0.7 | **Enforce `is_domain_verified` for sensitive actions** | Field exists but never checked. Unverified orgs should NOT be able to: post Gold jobs, verify claims, appear in company directory. | `done` |
| P0.8 | **Remove public debug endpoint** | `/api/jobs/match/debug` exposes API key info in production. Remove immediately. | `done` |
| P0.9 | **Sanitize `next` param on redirects** | `/?auth=signup&next=https://evil.com` could redirect to malicious sites. Validate `next` starts with `/` and has no `//`. | `done` |
| P0.10 | Stamp Jobs tab shows 0 jobs as default | First click on "Jobs" = empty page. Default to Internet Jobs tab when Stamp Jobs count is 0. | `done` |
| P0.11 | "Verified" vs "confirmed" used interchangeably | Pick ONE word and use it everywhere across profile, landing page, dashboard. | `done` |
| P0.12 | No privacy policy or terms of service | Platform handling employment data with zero legal pages. Need Privacy Policy + Terms of Service. | `todo` |
| P0.13 | JSearch API timeout on Render free tier | 10-second timeout too short. Increase to 30 seconds. Resume matching (the hook) fails silently. | `todo` |
| P0.14 | **Dead end when both Stamp and external jobs return empty** | User uploads resume, gets 0 results, no explanation. Need distinct empty states. | `done` |
| P0.15 | **Backend `notice` not rendered on frontend** | When JSearch quota exhausted, backend returns `notice` but frontend ignores it. Silent failure. | `done` |

---

## P1 — Trust + Conversion Blockers

These prevent users from completing key actions or weaken the trust model.

| # | Issue | Details | Status |
|---|-------|---------|--------|
| P1.1 | **Send invitation emails** | Admin creates invite but invitee never notified. Wire up Resend email on invite. (`routes/team.py:149`) | `done` |
| P1.2 | **Require Supabase email verification for workspace join** | Unverified emails can join workspaces via domain match. Check `email_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL`. | `done` |
| P1.3 | **Add 30-day invitation expiry** | Invite records live forever with `status=invited`. Auto-expire after 30 days. | `todo` |
| P1.4 | **Rate limit outreach (10/day per member)** | Any member with `can_post_jobs` can message unlimited candidates. Add daily cap. | `done` |
| P1.5 | **Show correction diff before acceptance** | Candidate accepts org corrections blindly. Show side-by-side diff before accepting. (`routes/claims.py:312-365`) | `done` |
| P1.6 | **Contested domain handling** | If someone tries to register a domain already taken, show "This company is already on Stamp. Request to join instead." | `todo` |
| P1.7 | **Per-user claim rate limit (10 pending)** | No limit on pending claims. Add max 10 pending claims per user to prevent claim farming. | `done` |
| P1.8 | **Subdomain normalization** | `mail.google.com` doesn't match `google.com`. Normalize to root domain for matching. | `done` |
| P1.9 | **Create audit_logs table** | Zero audit trail. Create table: `actor_id`, `action`, `resource_type`, `resource_id`, `metadata`, `ip_address`, `created_at`. | `done` |
| P1.10 | **Log all verification actions** | Every verify/correct/dispute writes to audit_logs. Who did it, when, what changed. | `done` |
| P1.11 | **Log all permission changes** | Admin grants/revokes permissions, member joins/leaves → audit log. | `done` |
| P1.12 | Allow any role at company domain for registration | `founder@startup.com` gets rejected. Accept any `@company.com` email, not just role-based (hr@, people@). Reconciles with P0.1: match domain, accept any role. | `todo` |
| P1.13 | **`from=match` context lost for first-time users** | Banner only shows when profile exists. Show context during profile creation. | `done` |
| P1.14 | **Double-counted rate limit** | Rate limit checks in both `job_search.py` and `job_match.py`. One upload burns two slots. Check once at route level. | `todo` |
| P1.15 | **"Get Verified" CTA doesn't connect to job matching** | Should say "Stand out when you apply — get your experience verified." | `done` |
| P1.16 | Company not in Clearbit = dead end for candidates | Need "Can't find your company? Enter details manually" fallback. | `todo` |
| P1.17 | No "View public profile" button on dashboard | Users don't know what their profile looks like. | `todo` |
| P1.18 | "Internet Jobs" naming is confusing | Rename to "Job Matcher" or "AI Job Match". | `todo` |
| P1.19 | No terms checkbox on signup | Legal requirement. Add "By signing up you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy". | `todo` |
| P1.20 | Apply flow doesn't enforce 1-verified-claim on frontend | Backend enforces but frontend shows confusing error. Add frontend check. | `todo` |
| P1.21 | Register page: verification email fallback contradicts validation | Empty defaults to user's email, fails role-based validation. Fix or clarify. | `todo` |
| P1.22 | No step indicator on employer registration | Add progress indicator. | `todo` |
| P1.23 | Job description renders as plain text | Need markdown rendering on job detail page. | `todo` |
| P1.24 | Salary field doesn't specify period | Add period selector: annual/monthly/hourly. | `todo` |
| P1.25 | No social proof anywhere | Add "Launching 2026" badge or early user count when available. | `todo` |

- 173 tests passing
- Vercel Analytics integration
- Full verification architecture audit → `VERIFICATION_TODO.md`
- YC S26 application drafted
- Documentation updated (README, ROADMAP, TASKS, TODO, VERIFICATION_TODO)

## Completed (2026-03-17 — Verification Hardening + Trust Policy + Trust UX)

Security hardening:
- Removed `/api/jobs/match/debug` endpoint (API key exposure)
- Sanitized `next` redirect param (open redirect fix)
- Removed legacy `admin_email` fallback in auth middleware (org takeover vector)
- Blocked 30+ public email domains from org registration
- Enforced `is_domain_verified` on: job posting, claim verify/correct/dispute (dashboard + token), talent search, job matches, outreach
- Required admin approval for self-join (pending status with approve/deny endpoints)
- Added 30-day TTL to verification tokens (`token_expires_at` column + check in verify endpoints)
- Token expiry returns 410 with clear "expired" message

Trust infrastructure:
- Invitation emails sent via Resend on invite/re-invite
- Supabase email verification required for workspace join
- `audit_logs` table created; verification, permission, and member actions logged
- Per-user claim rate limit (max 10 pending)
- Subdomain normalization for domain matching (`mail.google.com` → `google.com`)
- Correction diff endpoints (`GET /api/claims/{type}/{id}/correction-diff`)
- Cron job updated to use `token_expires_at` as primary expiry signal

Trust policy:
- Candidates must have 1+ verified claim before outreach (checked in `send_outreach`)
- Recruiters must have verified domain for talent search, job matches, and outreach
- Removed hard 10/day outreach cap; replaced with anti-abuse (per-org-per-candidate 7-day cooldown, duplicate prevention, suspicious volume logging at 50+/24h)
- Candidate block-company feature: block/unblock/list endpoints + blocked companies filtered from talent search and outreach
- DNS TXT domain verification: start + check endpoints (`/api/organizations/mine/dns-verify/start|check`)
- `blocked_companies` table, `dns_verification_token`/`dns_verified_at` columns on organizations

Trust UX:
- DNS verification UI in employer settings (start → instructions with copy buttons → check → success state)
- Domain verification banner on employer dashboard with gold badge when verified
- Domain-gated state on talent search page with CTA to settings
- Candidate trust-state guidance: open-to-work warning when 0 verified, waiting-for-verification nudge, updated welcome steps
- Frontend apply button gating: checks verified claim count before showing apply button (unverified sees explanation + link to dashboard)
- Block company button in messaging outreach banner + blocked companies list in candidate settings with unblock
- Standardized "confirmed" → "verified" across 8 frontend files
- Expanded verifier email policy: `founder@`, `admin@`, `ceo@`, `office@`, `info@` etc. now accepted alongside `hr@`, `people@`, `careers@`
- `is_domain_verified` returned from membership endpoint for frontend awareness
- Notice banner rendered on match-jobs and jobs pages (quota exhaustion etc.)
- Auto-switch to Internet Jobs tab when Stamp Jobs count is 0
- `from=match` context shown during profile creation
- Token expiry shows "Link expired" heading on verify page
- 174 tests passing, 2 migrations (009, 010)

## Session Context for Next Conversation

- **Product:** stampverified.com — verified professional identity platform
- **Stack:** FastAPI + Next.js 16 + Supabase + Resend + JSearch API
- **Stage:** Live product, pre-users, pre-revenue. Private alpha ready.
- **Founder:** Shreyas Krishnareddy, solo founder, graduated May 2025
- **Key files:** TASKS.md (build history), ROADMAP.md (product plan), VERIFICATION_TODO.md (trust architecture), this file (TODO)
- **GitHub:** github.com/Shreyaskrishnareddy/stampverified
- **Badge system:** Blue check = candidates/claims, Gold check = companies/hiring teams
- **Tagline:** "Your career. Verified."
- **Key decision:** Verification is the product. Resume matching is the hook.
- **Trust model:** Progressive — email match → verifier inbox → DNS verification. DNS is NOT a gate, it's a premium trust upgrade.
- **Trust enforcement (implemented):**
  - Candidates: 1+ verified claim required to apply, enter recruiter pool, or be contacted
  - Recruiters: domain-verified company + approved membership + explicit permissions
  - Companies: can onboard freely; DNS verification unlocks premium trust actions
  - Anti-abuse: per-org cooldown on outreach, candidate block-company, audit logging, claim rate limits
- **Migrations:** 10 total (001-010). 009 + 010 must be run for trust hardening features.
- **Tests:** 174 passing
- **Readiness:** 7.5/10 for private alpha. Blocking items: run migrations, deploy, verify one test org's domain.

## What 9/10 Feels Like

A user uploads a resume, sees useful jobs, understands the difference between
web jobs and Stamp jobs, signs up smoothly, lands in the right place, understands
exactly what to do next, and never hits a confusing or suspicious edge case.

**The gap from current state to 9/10 (updated 2026-03-17):**

1. ~~Fix P0.1-P0.9 security items~~ — DONE
2. ~~Fix the dead-end when both Stamp and external jobs return empty~~ — DONE
3. ~~Preserve `from=match` context through profile creation~~ — DONE
4. ~~Render quota/notice states and explain when external jobs are unavailable~~ — DONE
5. ~~Rewrite "Get Verified" CTA to connect job matching → verification → stronger applications~~ — DONE

**Remaining gap:**

1. Privacy Policy + Terms of Service (legal, not code)
2. First real verified company (cold start — manually verify or use DNS flow)
3. JSearch API timeout increase on Render (P0.13)
4. Error monitoring / Sentry (P3.20)

These changes turn "clever feature" into "trustworthy product."
